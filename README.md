_This project/framework is the key component of **[Automatic Non-rigid Histological Image Registration (ANHIR)](https://anhir.grand-challenge.org)** challenge hosted at [ISBI 2019](https://biomedicalimaging.org/2019/challenges/) conference. The related discussion is hosted on [forum.image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/tags/anhir)._

---

The project contains a set of sample images with related landmark annotations and experimental evaluation of state-of-the-art image registration methods.

The initial [dataset of stained histological tissues](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~borovji3/?page=dataset) is composed by image pairs of related sections (mainly, consecutive cuts).
Each image in the pair is coloured with a different stain. 
The registration of those images is a challenging task due to both artefacts and deformations acquired during sample preparation and appearance differences due to staining. 
For evaluation, we have manually placed landmarks in each image pair. There are at least 40 uniformly spread over the tissue. 
We do not put any landmarks in the background.
For more information about annotation creation and landmarks handling, we refer to the special repository - [Dataset: histology landmarks](http://borda.github.com/dataset-histology-landmarks).

![images-landmarks](figures/images-landmarks.jpg)

The dataset is defined by a CSV file containing paths to target and sensed image and their related landmarks _(see `./data_images/pairs-imgs-lnds_mix.csv`)_. With the change of the cover table, the benchmarks can be used for any other image dataset.

## Before benchmarks (pre-processing) 

In the `data_images` folder we provide some sample images with landmarks for registration. 
These sample registration pairs are saved in `data_images/pairs-imgs-lnds_mix.csv`. 
You can create your own costume cover table for a given dataset (folder with images and landmarks) by hand or use script `bm_dataset/create_registration_pairs.py` assuming the same folder structure `<dataset>/<image-set>/<scale>/<images-and-landmarks>` as for the [CIMA dataset](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~borovji3/?page=dataset).

### Prepare synthetic data

There is a script to generate synthetic data. 
Just set an initial image and their corresponding landmarks. 
The script will generate a set of geometrically deformed images mimicking different stains and compute the new related landmarks.

```bash
python bm_dataset/create_real_synth_dataset.py \
    -i ./data_images/images/Rat_Kidney_HE.jpg \
    -l ./data_images/landmarks/Rat_Kidney_HE.csv \
    -o ./output/synth_dataset \
    -nb 5 --nb_workers 3 --visual
```

### Creating an image-pairs table

When the synthetic datasets have been created, the cover csv file which contains the registration pairs (Reference and Moving image (landmarks)) is generated. 
Two modes are created: _"first2all"_ for registering the first image to all others and _"each2all"_ for registering each image to all other. 
_(note A-B is the same as B-A)_

```bash
python bm_dataset/generate_regist_pairs.py \
    -i ./data_images/synth_dataset/*.jpg \
    -l ./data_images/synth_dataset/*.csv \
    -csv ./data_images/cover_synth-dataset.csv \
    --mode each2all
```

### Customize the images and landmarks

We offer a script for scaling images in to particular scales for example
```bash
python bm_dataset/rescale_tissue_images.py \
    -i "./data_images/rat-kidney_/scale-5pc/*.jpg" \
    -scales 10 -ext .png --nb_workers 2
```

We introduce an option how to randomly take only a subset (use `nb_selected`) of annotated landmarks and also add some synthetic point (filling points up to `nb_total`) which are across set aligned using estimate affine transformation.

```bash
python bm_dataset/rescale_tissue_landmarks.py \
    -a ./data_images -d ./output \
    --nb_selected 0.5 --nb_total 200
``` 

Moreover we developed two additional script for converting large images, handling multiple tissue samples in single image and crop to wide background.
 * `bm_dataset/convert_tiff2png.py` converts TIFF or SVS image to PNG in a particular level
 * `bm_dataset/split_images_two_tissues.py` splits two tissue samples with clear wide bound in vertical or horizontal direction
 * `bm_dataset/crop_tissue_images.py` crops the tissue sample removing wide homogeneous background

## Experiments with included methods

Even though this framework is completely customizable we include several image registration methods commonly used in medical imaging.

![visualise-regist-results](figures/registration_visual_landmarks.jpg)

### Install methods and run benchmarks

For each registration method, different experiments can be performed independently using different values of the parameters or image pairs sets. 

Sample execution of the "empty" benchmark template:
```bash
python birl/bm_template.py \
    -t ./data_images/pairs-imgs-lnds_mix.csv \
    -o ./results \
    -cfg sample_config.yaml \
    --preprocessing matching-rgb gray \
    --unique --visual
```
or with relative paths:
```bash
python birl/bm_template.py \
    -t ./data_images/pairs-imgs-lnds_histol.csv \
    -d ./data_images \
    -o ./results \
    -cfg sample_config.yaml \
    --preprocessing gray matching-rgb
```

The general Image Registration benchmarks contain couple required and optional parameters which are shared among 'all' methods/benchmarks. The brief description is following...

**Required** parameters:
* `-t`/`--path_table` path to the cover table describing image/landmarks registration pairs
* `-d`/`--path_dataset` path to the dataset folder with images and landmarks
* `-o`/`--path_out` output path for saving results

**Optional** parameters:
* `--preprocessing` offer some image pre-processing before image registration starts, the order defines order of performed operations; the options are `matching-<color-space>` (where `<color-space>` is for example `rgb` or `hsv`) equalise source to target image and `gray` converting both images to gray-scale
* `--unique` each experiment has creation stamp included in its name (prevent overwriting experiments with the same method)
* `--visual` generate a simple visualisation of particular image registrations

![preprocessing-hist-matching](figures/Rat-Kidney_histogram-matching.jpg)

Measure your computer performance using average execution time on several simple image registrations.
The registration consists of loading images, denoising, feature detection, transform estimation and image warping. 
```bash
python bm_experiments/bm_comp_perform.py -o ./results
```
This script generate simple report exported in JSON file on given output path.

Some more image registration methods integrated in ImageJ are listed in [Registration](https://imagej.net/Registration).


### Add custom registration method

The only limitation of adding costume image registration methods that it has to be launched from python script or command line. The new registration benchmark should be inherited from [ImRegBenchmark](birl/benchmark.py) as for example [BmTemplate](birl/bm_template.py).

The benchmark workflow is the following:
1. `self._prepare()` prepare the experiment, e.g. create experiment folder, copy configurations, etc.
2. `self._load_data()` the load required data - the experiment cover file
3. `self._run()` perform the sequence of experiments (optionally in parallel) and save experimental results (registration outputs and partial statistic) to common table and optionally do particular visualisation of performed experiments
4. `self._evaluate()` evaluate results of all performed experiments
4. `self._summarise()` summarize and export results from complete benchmark.

General methods that should be overwritten:
 * `_check_required_params(...)` verify that all required input parameters are given _[on the beginning of benchmark]_
 * `_prepare_img_registration(...)` if some extra preparation before running own image registrations are needed _[before each image registration experiment]_
 * `_execute_img_registration` execute/perform the image registration, time of this methods is measured as execution time. In case you call external method from command line, just rewrite `_generate_regist_command(...)` which prepare the registration command to be executed, also you can add generating complete registration script/macro if needed; _[core of each image registration experiment]_
 * `_extract_warped_image_landmarks(...)` extract the required warped landmarks or perform landmark warping in this stage if it was not already part of the image registration _[after each image registration experiment]_
 * `_extract_execution_time(...)` optionally extract the execution time from the external script _[after each image registration experiment]_
 * `_clear_after_registration(...)` removing some temporary files generated during image registration _[after each image registration experiment]_

The new image registration methods should be added to `bm_experiments` folder.


### Re-evaluate experiment

In case you need to re-compute evaluation or add visualisation to existing experiment you can use the following script. 
The script require complete experiment folder with standard `registration-results.scv` (similar to registration pairs extended by experiment results). 

```bash
python bm_experiments/evaluate_experiment.py \
    -e ./results/BmUnwarpJ \
    --visual
```
