The project aims at automatic evaluation of state-of-the-art image registration
 methods based on landmark annotation for given image dataset. In particular,
 this project is the main evaluation framework for ANHIR challenge.

## Main Features
* **automatic** execution of image registration on a sequence of image pairs
* integrated **evaluation** of registration performances
* integrated **visualization** of performed registration
* running several image registration experiment in **parallel**
* **resuming** unfinished sequence of registration benchmark
* handling around dataset and **creating own experiments**
* rerun evaluation and visualisation for finished experiments
