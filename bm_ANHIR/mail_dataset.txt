Dear <NAME>,

You are receiving this email because we believe you can be interested to participate in the Automatic Non-rigid Histological Image Registration (ANHIR, https://anhir.grand-challenge.org) challenge. If you consider participating, please join the challenge at your earliest convenience (you need to create an account at grand-challenge.org if you have not done yet). This will allow us for better planning. Joining is also a prerequisite for downloading the data.

A large number of images are now available for download. We have updated our download instructions (https://anhir.grand-challenge.org/Download).

Let us remind you that we will have a challenge workshop at the ISBI conference (https://biomedicalimaging.org/2019) where the winners will be announced and the best methods presented. We would also like to write a journal article with the challenge results.

Do not hesitate to ask if you have any questions or comments.
Good luck and we are looking forward to meeting you in Venice.
Jiří Borovec & Arrate Munoz-Barrutia & Jan Kybic & Ignacio Arganda
