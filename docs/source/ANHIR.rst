ANHIR challenge
===============

The `ANHIR challenge`__ aims at the automatic nonlinear image registration of 2D microscopy images of histopathology tissue samples stained with different dyes. The task is difficult due to non-linear deformations affecting the tissue samples, different appearance of each stain, repetitive texture, and the large size of the whole slide images.
